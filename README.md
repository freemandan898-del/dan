# Minimal Stacked-Word Landing Page

A GitHub Pages–ready template that mirrors the *look and function* of **dangriffith.co.uk**: three stacked words and a single external link. Fully editable, no build tools required.

## How to use
1. **Fork or download** this folder and push to a GitHub repo named `<username>.github.io` (or any repo with Pages enabled).
2. In the repo, go to **Settings → Pages** and select the **main branch** (root) for deployment.
3. Edit text in `index.html`:
   ```html
   <h1 class="stack">
     <span>designer</span>
     <span>musician</span>
     <span>maker</span>
   </h1>
   <nav class="links">
     <a href="https://your.link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@your_handle</a>
   </nav>
   ```
4. (Optional) Replace `assets/favicon.svg` with your own.
5. That’s it — your site is live.

## Notes
- This project does **not** copy proprietary assets or code from any site; it’s an original implementation inspired by a similar minimal layout.
- Dark mode honors the OS preference. Press **L** to toggle light/dark temporarily.
